## Getting Started 🏁

Follow these instructions to set up the ATLAS client for local development.

### Prerequisites 📋

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

1.  **Visual Studio 2022** 🧑‍💻
    * You **must** include the **".NET Multi-platform App UI development"** workload.
2.  **Windows Developer Mode** ⚙️
    * Go to **Settings** > **Privacy & security** > **For developers** and turn **Developer Mode** on.

### Installation & Setup ⚙️

1.  **Clone the Frontend Repository and install Git LFS:**
    ```sh
    git lfs install
    git clone [https://github.com/inthezone006/atlas-winui.git](https://github.com/inthezone006/atlas-winui.git)
    cd atlas-winui
    ```
2.  **Open the Solution:**
    * Open the `ATLAS.sln` file with Visual Studio 2022. Visual Studio should automatically restore the required NuGet packages.
3.  **Connect to the Backend:** 🔗
    * For ease of development, you can connect the client directly to the live, deployed backend.
    * Go through the C# files in the `Pages` folder and ensure all API URLs point to:
        `https://atlas-backend-fkgye9e7b6dkf4cj.westus-01.azurewebsites.net/`
    * **(Optional) Run Local Backend:** If you wish to run the backend locally, clone the [backend repository](https://github.com/inthezone006/atlas) and follow the setup instructions in its `README` file. Remember to update the API URLs in the WinUI 3 app to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
